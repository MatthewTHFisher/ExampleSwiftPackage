# Example Swift Package
*The following repository is for learning and developing knowledge of swift packages and is not maintained.*

The project uses a [Swift package](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift_packages) that has multiple targets and [DocC documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/docc). The provided package has been developed to teach how swift packages are created in a way that multiple frameworks can sit within a singular swift package.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for learning, developing, and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

The only prerequisite is that Xcode 13.0 and above is used.

### Installing

To install the required libraries into the Arduino IDE there are two methods.

**1. Using Xcode's Swift Package Manager**
Go to File -> Add Packages... With the library manager open simply search for the package using the [GitHub link](https://github.com/MatthewTHFisher/ExampleSwiftPackage) of this page. Once the package has been fetched a list of all the optional frameworks that can be imported will be presented. Make sure atleast one is selected, there is no requirements for anyone of these to be added.
**Note: This method will allow not you to edit the package.**
   
**2. Manually downloading the package**
Clone the package using the clone button above. Once downloaded onto the PC simply go to File -> Add Packages... With the library manager open select the Add Local button and navigate to the downloaded package. This will add the package as a dependency to the project.
**Note: This method will allow you to edit the downloaded package.**
